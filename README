statsd - Statistics-gathering and processing daemon
===================================================

statsd collects statistics (from MQTT) that need some processing before
passing them on, and publishes the processed results (to MQTT).

An example would be the counting of events, so that the Web user interface
can directly access the counts instead of having to maintain them in the
less stable browser context.
